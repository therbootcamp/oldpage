      We are Dr. Dirk Wulff and Dr. Nathaniel Phillips, two Basel-based data scientists who have jointly spent over 20 years doing data science with R for both research and industry. We have taught dozens of courses in R in- and outside of University, written the free, online e-book <a href="https://bookdown.org/ndphillips/YaRrr/">YaRrr! The Pirateâ€™s Guide to R</a>, and are active R developers, having written several R packages including <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/cstab/index.html"><code>cstab</code></a>, <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/memnet/index.html"><code>memnet</code></a>, <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mousetrap/index.html"><code>mousetrap</code></a>, <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/yarrr/index.html" style="text-decoration:none;display:inline;color:#000000;white-space: nowrap"><code>yarrr</code></a>, and <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/FFTrees/index.html" style="text-decoration:none;display:inline;color:#000000;white-space: nowrap"><code>FFTrees</code></a>.

      We founded The R Bootcamp out of our passion to empower others to fulfill their own data science goals with R. Our goal is to teach you the latest tools and techniques to discover and communicate insights from data in a learning-friendly environment to ready you for the data revolution.

      Together with our Team of like-minded R enthusiast we  offer a diverse collection of Data Science courses in Switzerland and Germany.

      Currently we offer three standalone courses. Our courses are complementary and can be taken in any order. Beginners with no R or programming background we recommend, however, to first complete Intro to R for Data Science.

      Intro to R for Data Science teaching you the basics of R and how to use it to explore,, manipulate, and visualize data.

      Statistics with R teaching you the fundamentals of statistical inferenceand how to R to derive actionable analytics from data.

      Machine Learning with R teaching you the fundamentals of Machine Learning and how to use R to derive robust predictions from data.

      Our courses are composed of short, interactive presentations, introducing you to new topics and techniques, and longer hands-on practicals, during which you will work through step-by-step exercises designed to make you and active user of R. For every 5 participants there will be 1 instructor to be able to give you 1:1 support catering to your specific level and needs.
