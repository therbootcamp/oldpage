# dplyr
.pull-left4[

dplyr is a package for managing dataframes.

Anytime you want to slice, dice, aggregate, or manipulate a dataframe, there is almost certainly a way to do it in dplyr.

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "50%", fig.align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/therbootcamp/therbootcamp.github.io/master/_sessions/_image/dplyr_hex.png")
```

> *I need to know the mean birth rate only for countries in Africa from 1980 to 1980.*

> *What percent of female patients had adverse events to drug X during weeks 5 through 10?*

# dplyr

dplyr is a combination of 3 things:

1. **`objects`** like dataframes
2. **`verbs`** that **do** things to objects.
3. **`pipes`** `%>%` that string together objects and verbs

<br>


```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "70%", fig.align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/therbootcamp/therbootcamp.github.io/master/_sessions/_image/pipe.jpg")

knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/therbootcamp/therbootcamp.github.io/master/_sessions/_image/sequential.png")
```

dplyr is meant to be sequential and work like language

> Take data X, then do Y, then do Z...

Here's the basic structure of `dplyr` in action

```{r, eval = FALSE}
data %>%           # Start with data, and THEN
     VERB1 %>%     # Do VERB1, (and THEN)
     VERB2 %>% ... # Do VERB2, (and THEN)
```

x <- ChickWeight %>%  # Start with ChickWeight
  group_by(Diet) %>%  # Group by Diet

# Common dplyr verbs

| verb| action| example |
|:---|:----|:----------------|
|     `filter()`|    Select rows based on some criteria| `filter(age > 40 & sex == "m")`|
|     `arrange()`|    Sort rows| `arrange(date, group)`|
|     `select()`|    Select columns (and ignore all others)| `select(age, sex)`|
|     `rename()`|    Rename columns| `rename(DATE_MONTHS_X24, date`)|
|     `mutate()`|    Add new columns| `mutate(height.m = height.cm / 100)`|
|     `case_when()`|    Recode values of a column| `sex.n = case_when(sex == 0 ~ "m", sex == 1 ~ "f")`|
|     `group_by(), summarise()`|   Group data and then calculate summary statistics|`group_by(treatment) %>% summarise(...)` |






---

#### Example 1

*Add a column called `weight_d_time` that is weight divided by time*

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(dplyr)

x <- ChickWeight %>%          # Start with the ChickWeight data
      mutate(                 # Create new columns...
            weight_d_time = weight / Time
            )

head(x)   # Print the result
```



---

#### Example 2

*Add a column called `weight_d_time` that is weight divided by time AND `time_d` that is time in days*

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
x <- ChickWeight %>%          # Start with the ChickWeight data
      mutate(                 # Create new columns...
            weight_d_time = weight / Time,  # weight_d_time is weight divided by Time
            time_d = Time * 7               # time_d is Time times 7
            )

head(x)   # Print the result
```

### Recoding values with case_when()

.pull-left4[
Recoding values is a common data wrangling task. You can easily do this with `case_when()`:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
data %>%
  mutate(
  var_new = case_when(
    var_old == OLD_A ~ NEW_A,
    var_old == OLD_B ~ NEW_B
  )
```

For example, in a dataset, the column `sex` might be coded with 1s and 0s.

You might want to create a new column `sex_new` where 1 = "female" and 0 = "male":

| sex| sex_new|
|------:|----:|
|    1|   "female"|
|    0|   "male"|

]

.pull-right5[

To change the value of 1 to `"female"`, and 0 to `"male"`, you can use `case_when()`:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Add a column sex_new to data 

data <- data %>% 
  mutate(
        sex_new = case_when(
          sex == 1 ~ "female",
          sex == 0 ~ "male"
        )
  )
```


You can think about the code above as follows:

- Create a new column `sex_new` where
    - If `sex == 1`, then set the value to `"female"`
    - If `sex == 0`, then set the value to `"male"`

#### Example 3

*Create a new variable Diet_name which shows Diet in text format. Here is a table of the values*

| Diet| Diet_name|
|------:|----:|
|    1|   "fruit"|
|    2|   "vegetables"|
|    3|   "meat"|
|    4|   "grains"|

]

.pull-right5[
<br>
<br>
```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, eval = TRUE}

ChickWeight <- ChickWeight %>%           # Start with the ChickWeight data
                 mutate(
                   Diet_name = case_when(
                     Diet == 1 ~ "fruit",
                     Diet == 2 ~ "vegetables",
                     Diet == 3 ~ "meat",
                     Diet == 4 ~ "grains"
                   )
   
 )

head(ChickWeight)
```

]

---

#### Example 4

*For each Diet, calculate the mean weight*

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
ChickWeight %>%           # Start with the ChickWeight data
  group_by(Diet) %>%      # Group the data by Diet
  summarise(              # Now summarise....
    weight.mean = mean(weight) # Mean weight
  )
```

---

#### Example 5

*For each time period less than 10, calculate the mean weight*

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
ChickWeight %>%                # Start with the ChickWeight data
  filter(Time < 10) %>%        # Only Time periods less than 10
  group_by(Time) %>%           # Group the data by Diet
  summarise(                   # Now summarise....
    weight.mean = mean(weight) # Mean weight
  )
```

---
#### Example 6

*For each Diet, calculate the mean weight, maximum time, and the number of chicks on each diet*:

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
ChickWeight %>%           # Start with the ChickWeight data
  group_by(Diet) %>%      # Group the data by Diet
  summarise(              # Now summarise....
    weight.mean = mean(weight), # Mean weight
    time.max = max(Time),       # Max time
    N = n()                     # Number of observations
  )
```

---

# Other dplyr verbs

| verb| action| example |
|:---|:----|:----------------|
|     `sample_n()`|    Select a random sample of n rows| `sample_n(10)`|
|     `sample_frac()`|    Select a random fraction of rows| `sample_frac(.20)`|
|     `first(), last()`|    Give the first (or last) observation| `first(), last()`|

---

#### Example 7

*Give me a random sample of 10 rows from the ChickWeight dataframe, but only show me the values for Chick and weight*

```{r}
# Give me a random sample of 10 rows, but only show me columns Chick and weight

ChickWeight %>% 
  select(Chick, weight) %>%
  sample_n(10)
```

#dplyr

```{r}
# Create a new object called time_agg

#dplyr summary

dplyr is great for elegantly performing sequential operations on data.

The 'pipe' operator `%>%` helps you string multiple *objects* (like dataframes) and *verbs* (summarise, order, aggregate...) together.

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "50%", fig.align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/therbootcamp/therbootcamp.github.io/master/_sessions/_image/dplyr_hex.png")
```

Basic structure of dplyr commands:

  VERB2 %>% # Do VERB2, AND THEN...
  VERB3 %>% # Do VERB3, AND THEN...
  group_by(x, y) %>%  # Group by variables x, y
    summarise(
      VAR_A_New = fun(X),
      VAR_B_New = fun(Y)
    )
  )
```
