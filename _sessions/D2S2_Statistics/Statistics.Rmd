- General linear model 
    - `glm`, `aov`

- Common methods
    - `print()`, `summary()`, `names()`, `predict()`, `plot()`

- Accessing elements from statistical objects with `$`

### Examples

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# T-test comparing weights from Diets 1 and 2
t.test(formula = weight ~ Diet,
       data = Chickweight,
       subset = Diet %in% c(1, 2))

# Regression model

weight_glm <- glm(formula = weight ~ .,
                  data = ChickWeight)

# Summary information
summary(weight_glm)

weight_glm$coefficients # Acess coefficients
weight_glm$coefficients # Access residuals


### Generate random data
x1 <- rnorm(n = 100, mean = 10, sd = 5)
x2 <- rnorm(n = 100, mean = 5, sd = 1)
noise <- rnorm(n= 100, mean = 2, sd = 10)

# Create y as a function of x1, x2, and noise
y <- x1 + x2 + noise

```

# Basic structure of statistical tests

.pull-left4[

### Formula

- Most statistical functions require a `formula` argument

> `formula = y ~ a + b + ...`

Means...

> Model a dependent variable `y` as a function of `a` and `b` and `...`

- Formulas go together with dataframes `data` containing all variables in the formula.

]

.pull-right6[

### General structure of a hypothesis test and formula

```{r, eval = FALSE}
my.test(formula = y ~ a + b, # Formula
        data = my.data,      # Dataframe
        ...                  # Additional
        )
```

- `y` is the dependent variable (e.g.; age), `a` and `b` are independent variables
- `data` is a dataframe containing the variables in `formula`; (`y`, `a`, `b`)
-  `...` additional arguments specific to test

## Regression example with `glm()`

```{r}
head(ChickWeight)
```

**Goal**: Create a regression model predicting `weight` as a function of Time

<br>
$$\Large weight = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1} \times Time + \epsilon$$
]

.pull-right55[

- Function: `glm()`
- Formula: `formula = weight ~ Time`
- Data: `data = ChickWeight`

```{r}
# Create a glm object 

# formula: weight ~ Time
# data: ChickWeight

chick_glm <- glm(formula = weight ~ Time,
                 data = ChickWeight)


# Print the object
chick_glm
```
]


---

.pull-left7[
## Using formulas

You can keep adding terms with `+` 

```{r}
# Include multiple terms with +
chick_glm_A <- glm(formula = weight ~ Time + Diet + Chick,
                   data = ChickWeight)
```

To include *all* variables, use the generic notation <font color = "blue"> `formula = y ~ .`</font>

```{r}
# Use  y ~ . to include ALL variables
chick_glm_B <- glm(formula = weight ~ .,
                   data = ChickWeight)
```

To include *interaction terms* use `*`

```{r}
# Include an interaction term between Time and Diet
chick_glm_C <- glm(formula = weight ~ Time * Diet + Chick,
                   data = ChickWeight)
```

## Exploring statistical objects

You can apply many *generic* functions to statistical objects such as `print()`, `summary()`, `predict()` and `plot()`.


```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Create statistical object
my_obj <- FUN(formula = ...,
              data = ...)

print(my_obj)       # Print
summary(my_obj)     # Summary
plot(my_obj)        # Plotting
predict(my_obj, ..) # Predict

```

**Apply generic functions to a statistical object**

```{r, eval = TRUE}
# Create a glm object
chick_glm <- glm(formula = weight ~ Time,
                 data = ChickWeight)

# Print the object
print(chick_glm)
```

## Exploring statistical objects

The output of a statistical function is always a list with many named elements.

Different statistical #objects have different **classes** with different outputs.

To see what is inside of a statistical object, use the `names()` function:

Once you know the names of the elements, use `$` to access them!

]

.pull-right6[

```{r}
chick_glm <- glm(formula = weight ~ Time + Diet,
                 data = ChickWeight)

# What class is this object?
class(chick_glm)

# What are the named elements?
names(chick_glm)

# Access the coefficients
chick_glm$coefficients
```

## Common 1 or 2 sample hypothesis tests

| Test| R Function|
|------:|----:|
|     T-test|    `t.test()`|
|     Correlation Test|    `cor.test()`|
|     Chi-Square Test|   `chisq.test()`|

### Check help menus!

- Different statistical functions require different arguments.

- Look at the help menus to know exactly what arguments each function needs.

#### Always check help menus!

`?t.test`

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "80%", fig.align = 'center'}

## t-tests with `t.test()`

.pull-left3[

### ChickWeight data
```{r, eval = FALSE}
ChickWeight
```


```{r, echo = FALSE}
set.seed(102)
x <- ChickWeight[sample(nrow(ChickWeight)),]
rownames(x) <- NULL
head(x)
```

]

.pull-right65[

### One sample t-test

> Is the mean weight of the chicks significantly different from 120?

```{r, eval = TRUE}
t.test(x = ChickWeight$weight,      # Vector of values 
       alternative = "two.sided",   # Two sided test
       mu = 120)                    # Null is 120

## t-tests with `t.test()`

.pull-left3[

### ChickWeight data
```{r, eval = FALSE}
ChickWeight
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
set.seed(102)
x <- ChickWeight[sample(nrow(ChickWeight)),]
rownames(x) <- NULL
head(x)
```

]

.pull-right65[

### Two sample t-test

> Is the mean weight of the chicks on Diet 1 different from Diet 2?

```{r, eval = TRUE}
t.test(formula = weight ~ Diet,    # Formula
       data = ChickWeight,         # Data in Chickweight
       subset = Diet %in% c(1, 2)) # Only Diets 1,2
```

## Correlation test with `cor.test()`

.pull-left3[

### ChickWeight data
```{r, eval = FALSE}
ChickWeight
```


```{r, echo = FALSE}
set.seed(102)
x <- ChickWeight[sample(nrow(ChickWeight)),]
rownames(x) <- NULL
head(x)
```

]

.pull-right65[

### Correlation Test

> Is there a correlation between weight and Time?

- For `cor.test()`, formula looks like `formula = ~ a + b`

```{r, eval = TRUE}
cor.test(formula = ~ weight + Time, # Formula
         data = ChickWeight)          # Data in Chickweight

```

]

## Chi-Square test with `chisq.test()`

.pull-left3[

### ChickWeight data
```{r, eval = FALSE}
ChickWeight
```


```{r, echo = FALSE}
set.seed(102)
x <- ChickWeight[sample(nrow(ChickWeight)),]
rownames(x) <- NULL
head(x)
```


]

.pull-right65[

### Chi-Square test

> Are there more observations from one Diet than another?

- For `chisq.test()`, main argument should be a table of values created from the `table()` function:

```{r, eval = TRUE}
table(ChickWeight$Diet)   # Look at a table of frequencies

chisq.test(x = table(ChickWeight$Diet)) # Run test on table
```

]


---
# htest objects

.pull-left5[

### Assigning hypothesis test objects

- Most hypothesis tests return an object of class `"htest"` which contain many values
- You can assign the results of a hypothesis test to an object, and then extract the info you want with the `$` operator:

#### Examples of what's in htest objects

| Element| Result|
|------:|----:|
|    `x$statistic`|    A test statistic|
|     `x$parameter`|    Degrees of freedom|
|     `x$p.value`|   The p-value|
|     `x$conf.int`|  Confidence interval|
]

.pull-right5[
### What's in an htest object?

```{r}
# One-sample t-test

weight.tt <- t.test(x = ChickWeight$weight,
                    mu = 120,
                    alternative = "two.sided")

class(weight.tt)

# What's in the weight.tt object?
names(weight.tt)

```

# Final notes

.pull-left7[

- When using a hypothesis test, always ask:

> What are the arguments?

> What format or class should the arguments be?

- When in doubt, always look at the help files and examples at the end.

- Save hypothesis tests as new objects, then apply `names()` to see what elements it contains, then extract what you want with `$`

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Run test and save as test_A
test_A <- t.test(formula = weight ~ Diet,
                 data = ChickWeight,
                 subset = Diet %in% c(1, 2))

names(test_A)  # What is in the object?

test_A$statistic # Ah ok! Show me the test statistic
```



]

.pull-right25[

`?t.test`

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "100%", fig.align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/therbootcamp/therbootcamp.github.io/master/_sessions/_image/ttesthelp_ss.png")

# Two types of statistics: Descriptive and Inferential

.pull-left4[

### Inferential

- Used to make inferences about a larger population. Typically done in tandem with a *hypothesis test*

#### Examples

| Hypothesis Test| R Function|
|------:|----:|
|     T-test|    `t.test()`|
|     Correlation Test|    `cor.test()`|
|     Chi-Square Test|   `chisq.test()`|
|     ANOVA, Post-hoc|    `aov(), TukeyHSD()`|

- Hypothesis tests typically return lists of outputs (e.g.; p-value, test statistic)


]

.pull-right55[
#### R implimentation

```{r}
t.test(x = c(4, 3, 6, 5, 3, 2),
       mu = 0,
       alternative = "two.sided")
```

# ANOVA with `aov()`

.pull-left3[

### ChickWeight data
```{r, eval = FALSE}
ChickWeight
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
set.seed(102)
x <- ChickWeight[sample(nrow(ChickWeight)),]
rownames(x) <- NULL
head(x)
```

]

.pull-right6[

### ANOVA

> Is there difference in weights based on Diet?

- Applying `summary()` to an `aov` object prints a nice table.

```{r, eval = TRUE}
E <- aov(formula = weight ~ Diet, # Formula
         data = ChickWeight)      # Data in Chickweight

summary(E)  # Sow a summary of the results
```

]

---
# Post-hoc tests with `TukeyHSD()`

.pull-left4[

> Which specific pairs of Diets differed?

### Step 1: Create aov object

- Apply `TukeyHSD()` to an `aov` object to get post-hoc tests.

```{r, eval = TRUE}
# Create an aov object called D

D <- aov(formula = weight ~ Diet,
         data = ChickWeight)
```

]

.pull-right55[

### Step 2: Apply `TukeyHSD()` to object
```{r}
TukeyHSD(D)  # Conduct post-hoc tests
```

]
