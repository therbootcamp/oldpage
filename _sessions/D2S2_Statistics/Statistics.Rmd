### In this tutorial we will cover

- How to calculate basic descriptive statistics
    - `mean()`, `median()`, `sd()`, ...

- How to conduct hypothesis tests and how to work with `htest` objects
    - `t.test()`, `cor.test()`, `aov()`, ...

### Examples

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# mean weight
mean(ChickWeight$weight)

# Standard deviation of Time
sd(ChickWeight$Time)

# T-test comparing weights from Diets 1 and 2
t.test(formula = weight ~ Diet,
       data = Chickweight,
       subset = Diet %in% c(1, 2))

# Correlation test between weight and Time
cor.test(formula = ~ weight + Time,
         data = ChickWeight)
```

# Two types of statistics: Descriptive and Inferential

.pull-left4[

### Descriptive

- Also called *sample statistics*
- Used to describe general characteristics of a sample
- Descriptive statistics typically a single scaler value


#### Examples

| Statistic| R Function|
|------:|----:|
|     Mean|    `mean(x)`|
|     Median|    `median(x)`|
|     Mode|   `mode(x)`|
|     Standard Deviation|    `sd(x)`|
]

.pull-right6[
#### R implimentation

```{r}
sd(c(5, 3, 6, 3, 2, 6))  # Standard deviation

mean(ChickWeight$weight) # Mean weight

median(ChickWeight$Time) # Mean Time
```


]

# Two types of statistics: Descriptive and Inferential

.pull-left4[

### Inferential

- Used to make inferences about a larger population. Typically done in tandem with a *hypothesis test*

#### Examples

| Hypothesis Test| R Function|
|------:|----:|
|     T-test|    `t.test()`|
|     Correlation Test|    `cor.test()`|
|     Chi-Square Test|   `chisq.test()`|
|     ANOVA, Post-hoc|    `aov(), TukeyHSD()`|

- Hypothesis tests typically return lists of outputs (e.g.; p-value, test statistic)


]

.pull-right6[
#### R implimentation

```{r}
t.test(x = c(4, 3, 6, 5, 3, 2),
       mu = 0,
       alternative = "two.sided")
```


]

# Inferential Statistics

.pull-left6[

### Different tests, different arguments

- A one-sample t-test requires just a vector, while an ANOVA requires more arguments.
- To see what arguments a test needs, consult the help menu (e.g.; `?t.test`)

#### Examples

| Hypothesis Test| Help code|
|------:|:----|
|     T-test|    `?t.test()`|
|     Correlation Test|    `?cor.test()`|
|     Chi-Square Test|   `?chisq.test()`|
|     ANOVA|    `?aov()`|
]

.pull-right3[
#### Always check help menus!

`?t.test`

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "80%", fig.align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics("../_image/ttesthelp_ss.png")
```

### Arguments to hypothesis tests

- Some arguments are manditory, and some are optional.
    - If you don't specify an optional argument, R will use a *default* value

#### Ex) Arguments to `t.test`

| Argument| Description| Default |
|------:|----:|:---|
|    `x`, `formula, data`|Vector OR a formula and data | *Required* |
|     `mu`|   Null hypothesis| 0 |
|     `alternative`| Alternative Hyp| `"two.sided"`| 
]

.pull-right45[

### Specifying arguments to a hypothesis test

```{r, eval = FALSE}

# 0: Won't work!
t.test()

# 1: Will work and use default arguments
t.test(x = ChickWeight$weight)

# 1b: Same as above
t.test(x = ChickWeight$weight,
       mu = 0,
       alternative = "two.sided")

# 2: Specified arguments
t.test(x = ChickWeight$weight,
       mu = 120,
       alternative = "greater")
```


]

# Inferential Statistics

.pull-left4[

### Formula

- Many tests allow you to include a `formula` argument

> `formula = y ~ a + b + ...`

Means...

> Model a dependent variable `y` as a function of `a` and `b` and `...`

- Formulas go together with dataframes `data` containing all variables in the formula, and optional `subset` arguments to specify which cases in `data` to include. 


]

.pull-right6[

### General structure of a hypothesis test and formula

```{r, eval = FALSE}
my.test(formula = y ~ a + b, # Formula
        data = my.data,      # Dataframe
        ...                  # Additional
        )
```

- `y` is the dependent variable (e.g.; age), `a` and `b` are independent variables
- `data` is a dataframe containing the variables in `formula`; (`y`, `a`, `b`)
-  `...` additional arguments specific to test

### Assigning hypothesis test objects

- Most hypothesis tests return an object of class `"htest"` which contain many values
- You can assign the results of a hypothesis test to an object, and then extract the info you want with the `$` operator:

#### Examples of what's in htest objects

| Element| Result|
|------:|----:|
|    `x$statistic`|    A test statistic|
|     `x$parameter`|    Degrees of freedom|
|     `x$p.value`|   The p-value|
|     `x$conf.int`|  Confidence interval|
]

.pull-right5[
### What's in an htest object?

```{r}
# One-sample t-test

weight.tt <- t.test(x = ChickWeight$weight,
                    mu = 120,
                    alternative = "two.sided")

class(weight.tt)

# What's in the weight.tt object?
names(weight.tt)

```

# Examples with ChickWeight Data


.pull-left4[

```{r, eval = FALSE}
ChickWeight
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
set.seed(102)
x <- ChickWeight[sample(nrow(ChickWeight)),]
rownames(x) <- NULL
head(x)
```



]


.pull-right6[

```{r, fig.cap = "Source: http://awallpapersimages.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Chicken-cute-baby-image.jpg", echo = FALSE}

# t-tests with `t.test()`

.pull-left3[

### ChickWeight data
```{r, eval = FALSE}
ChickWeight
```


```{r, echo = FALSE}
set.seed(102)
x <- ChickWeight[sample(nrow(ChickWeight)),]
rownames(x) <- NULL
head(x)
```


]

.pull-right6[

### One sample t-test

> Is the mean weight of the chicks significantly different from 120?

```{r, eval = TRUE}
A <- t.test(x = ChickWeight$weight, # Vector of values 
       alternative = "two.sided",   # Two sided test
       mu = 120)                    # Null is 120

A

### ChickWeight data
```{r, eval = FALSE}
ChickWeight
```


```{r, echo = FALSE}
set.seed(102)
x <- ChickWeight[sample(nrow(ChickWeight)),]
rownames(x) <- NULL
head(x)
```


]

.pull-right6[

### Two sample t-test

> Is the mean weight of the chicks on Diet 1 different from Diet 2?

```{r, eval = TRUE}
B <- t.test(formula = weight ~ Diet,    # Formula
            data = ChickWeight,         # Data in Chickweight
            subset = Diet %in% c(1, 2), # Only Diets 1,2
            alternative = 'two.sided')  # Two-sided test

B
```

# Correlation test with `cor.test()`

.pull-left4[

### ChickWeight data
```{r, eval = FALSE}
ChickWeight
```


```{r, echo = FALSE}
set.seed(102)
x <- ChickWeight[sample(nrow(ChickWeight)),]
rownames(x) <- NULL
head(x)
```


]

.pull-right6[

### Correlation Test

> Is there a correlation between weight and Time?

- For `cor.test()`, formula looks like `formula = ~ a + b`

```{r, eval = TRUE}
C <- cor.test(formula = ~ weight + Time, # Formula
              data = ChickWeight)          # Data in Chickweight

C
```

# Chi-Square test with `chisq.test()`

.pull-left4[

### ChickWeight data
```{r, eval = FALSE}
ChickWeight
```


```{r, echo = FALSE}
set.seed(102)
x <- ChickWeight[sample(nrow(ChickWeight)),]
rownames(x) <- NULL
head(x)
```


]

.pull-right6[

### Chi-Square test

> Are there more observations from one Diet than another?

- For `chisq.test()`, main argument should be a table of values created from the `table()` function:

```{r, eval = TRUE}
table(ChickWeight$Diet)  # Table of counts

D <- chisq.test(x = table(ChickWeight$Diet))

D
```

]





---
# ANOVA with `aov()`

.pull-left4[

### ChickWeight data
```{r, eval = FALSE}
ChickWeight
```


```{r, echo = FALSE}
set.seed(102)
x <- ChickWeight[sample(nrow(ChickWeight)),]
rownames(x) <- NULL
head(x)
```


]

.pull-right6[

### ANOVA

> Is there difference in weights based on Diet?

- Applying `summary()` to an `aov` object prints a nice table.

```{r, eval = TRUE}
E <- aov(formula = weight ~ Diet, # Formula
         data = ChickWeight)      # Data in Chickweight

summary(E)  # Sow a summary of the results
```



]




---
# Post-hoc tests with `TukeyHSD()`

.pull-left4[

### ChickWeight data
```{r, eval = FALSE}
ChickWeight
```


```{r, echo = FALSE}
set.seed(102)
x <- ChickWeight[sample(nrow(ChickWeight)),]
rownames(x) <- NULL
head(x)
```


]

.pull-right6[

### Post Hoc

> Which specific pairs of Diets differed?

- Apply `TukeyHSD()` to an `aov` object to get post-hoc tests.

```{r, eval = TRUE}
D <- aov(formula = weight ~ Diet, # Formula
         data = ChickWeight)      # Data in Chickweight

TukeyHSD(D)  # Conduct post-hoc tests on D
```

# Final notes

.pull-left7[

- When using a hypothesis test, always ask:

> What are the arguments?

> What format or class should the arguments be?

- When in doubt, always look at the help files and examples at the end.

- Save hypothesis tests as new objects, then apply `names()` to see what elements it contains, then extract what you want with `S`

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Run test and save as test_A
test_A <- t.test(formula = weight ~ Diet,
                 data = ChickWeight,
                 subset = Diet %in% c(1, 2))

names(test_A)  # What is in the object?

test_A$statistic # Ah ok! Show me the test statistic
```
