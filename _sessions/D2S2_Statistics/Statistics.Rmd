## We will cover...

Basic structure and arguments of most statistical functions
- `formula`, `data`
    
Simple `htest` objects (t.test, correlation)

Generalized linear model 
- `lm()`, `glm()`, `aov()`

Common methods to explore statistical objects
- `print()`, `summary()`, `names()`, `predict()`, `plot()`

Dissect statistical objects with `$`

Work with R's library of statistical distributions

# Basic structure of statistical functions

.pull-left4[

Statistical functions always require a dataframe of <b>data</b>

```{r, echo = FALSE}
baselers %>%
  slice(1:3) %>% select(2:6) %>% knitr::kable(format = 'markdown')
```

They also require a <b>formula</b> that specifies a dependent variable (y) as a function of one or more independent variables (x1, x2, ...) in the form:

<font size = 6>formula = y ~ x1 + x2 +...</font>

Note: The short hand formula = y ~ . means include <i>all</i> variables in the data

]

.pull-right55[

To create a statistical object, apply the statistical function `STAT_FUN` with the `formula` and `data` arguments:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/therbootcamp/Erfurt_2018June/master/_sessions/_image/formula_description.png")
```


```{r}
# Create regression object (my_glm)
my_glm <- glm(formula = income ~ age + height,
              data = baselers)
```

## Different tests have different arguments

Individual tests may have many optional arguments (look at help menus!)

Each of these have *default* values. If you don't specify them, the function will use the default.

To customise a test, look at the help menu and specifying arguments directly.

### ?glm()

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/therbootcamp/Erfurt_2018June/master/_sessions/_image/glm_help.jpg")

## Simple hypothesis tests

All of the basic one and two sample hypothesis tests are included in the stats package

|     Correlation Test|    `cor.test()`|
|     Chi-Square Test|   `chisq.test()`|

## Regression with glm(), lm()

.pull-left35[

Part of the `baselers` dataframe:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
baselers %>% 
  select(food, income, happiness) %>%
  slice(1:5) %>% 
  knitr::kable(format = "markdown")
```

**Goal**: Create a regression model predicting how much money people spend on `food` as a function of `income`

<br>
<!-- $$\Large food = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1} \times Inc + \beta_{1} \times Hap+ \epsilon$$ -->

]

.pull-right6[

To conduct a regression analysis, use `glm()` or `lm()`. `lm()` is for simple linear regression, while `glm()` is generalized. Both are part of the `stats` package (already loaded in R)


```{r}
# Create a glm object called food_glm

# food (y) on income (x1) and happiness (x2)
food_glm <- glm(formula = food ~ income + happiness,
              data = baselers)


# food_glm has clas "glm"
class(food_glm)
```

We now have a "glm" object called `food_glm` that stores all of the results of our regression analysis.

]


---

## Customising formulas

You can keep adding terms to formulas by "adding"" them with `+` 

```{r}
# Include multiple terms with +
my_glm <- glm(formula = income ~ food + alcohol + happiness + hiking,
              data = baselers)
```

To include *all* variables in a dataframe, use the catch-all notation <b>`formula = y ~ .`</b>

```{r}
# Use  y ~ . to include ALL variables
my_glm <- glm(formula = income ~ .,
              data = baselers)
```

To include *interaction terms* use `x1 * x2` instead of `x1 + x2`

```{r}
# Include an interaction term between food and alcohol
my_glm <- glm(formula = income ~ food * alcohol,
              data = baselers)
```

## Exploring statistical objects

Once you have created a statistical object, you can explore it using many *generic* functions such as `print()`, `summary()`, `predict()` and `plot()`.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Create statistical object
obj <- STAT_FUN(formula = ...,
                data = ...)

names(obj)       # Elements
print(obj)       # Print
summary(obj)     # Summary
plot(obj)        # Plotting
predict(obj, ..) # Predict
```

They won't work for all objects, but it is a great idea to try each of them!

<br>

```{r, eval = TRUE}

my_glm <- glm(formula = income ~ happiness + age,
              data = baselers)

```{r, eval = TRUE}
# Print the object
print(my_glm)

### Statistical objects are lists! Explore them!

Almost all statistical objects are *lists*. This means they all have named elements you can access with `$`. To see all of the named elements, use `names()`

```{r, eval = TRUE}
# What are the named elements
names(my_glm)
```
 
 
```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "70%", fig.align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/therbootcamp/Erfurt_2018June/master/_sessions/_image/list_tab.png")

## predict()

Many (but not all) statistical objects have an associated `predict()` method.

`predict()` allows you to use the model to make predictions for new data, and understand how the model works.



```{r, echo = FALSE}
lastyear <- baselers %>% slice(1:100)
thisyear <- baselers %>% slice(101:200)
```


```{r, eval = FALSE}
lastyear
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
lastyear  %>% select(id, age, fitness, tattoos, income) %>% 
  slice(1:3) %>% knitr::kable(format = "markdown")
```

]


.pull-right6[
Create model based on old data

```{r}
# Create regression model predicting income
mod <- lm(formula = income ~ age + fitness + tattoos,
          data = lastyear)

mod$coefficients
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
thisyear
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
thisyear  %>% select(id, age, fitness, tattoos) %>% slice(1:3) %>% knitr::kable(format = "markdown")
```


```{r}
# Predict the income of people in thisyear
predict(object = mod, 
        newdata = thisyear)[1:3]
```

.pull-left4[

## broom::tidy()

The `tidy()` function from the `broom` package allows you to convert the key results of *many* (like hundreds) of statistical object like "glm" to a data frame

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "70%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/therbootcamp/Erfurt_2018June/master/_sessions/_image/broom_hex.png")
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Install the broom package
install.packages("broom")
```


]

.pull-right55[

```{r}
# Load boom package
library(broom)

# Create a tidy dataframe from my_glm
tidy(my_glm)
```

The `tidy()` function works all kinds of common statistical objects, from classical regression to Bayesian models, to machine learning. 

```{r, echo = FALSE}
  infile <- system.file("extdata", "rstan_example.rda", package = "broom")
  load(infile)
```


```{r}
# rstan_example is a "stanfit" object
tidy(rstan_example)[1:5,]
```


Try it on your favorite models and see the magic!

## Sampling Functions

R gives you a host of functions for sampling data from common statistical distributions

| Distribution| R Function|
|------:|----:|
|    Normal| `rnorm()`|    
|      Uniform|`runif()`|
|      Beta|`rbeta()`|  
|      Binomial|`rbinom()`|  

You can use these to create simulations and play around with models

You can use `sample()` to draw random samples from a vector of values

## Summary

R has a package for every statistical procedure you can imagine.

Most require a formula, data, and other optional arguments

Use help menus to understand arguments and syntax!

Once you've created a statistical object, use generic methods (`print()`, `names()`, `summary()`), to explore it

Use random sampling functions to run simulations
