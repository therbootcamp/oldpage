# What is machine learning?

.pull-left6[


### Algorithms autonomously learning from data.

Given data, an algorithm tunes its *parameters* to match the data, understand how it works, and make predictions for what will occur in the future.

# Why do we separate training from prediction?

Just because an algorithm can fit past (training) data well, does *not* necessarily mean that it will *predict* new data well.

A_model <- A_fun(formula = y ~.,

                 ...)

## Regression with `glm()`

.pull-left5[

In regression, the criterion is modeled as the weighted sum of predictors times *weights* $\beta_{1}$, $\beta_{2}$

### Loan Default:

One could model the risk of defaulting on a loan as:

$$Risk = Age \times \beta_{age} + Income \times \beta_{income} + ...$$

Training a model means finding values of $\beta_{Age}$ and $\beta_{Income}$ that 'best' match the training data.

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE, out.width = "50%", fig.align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/therbootcamp/therbootcamp.github.io/master/_sessions/_image/regression.png")

    family, ...)        # Optional arguments

# Train glm model
loan_glm_model <- glm(formula = risk ~ ., 
                      data = data_train)

# How do I do machine learning in R?

.pull-left6[



In the practical, we will go through the basic steps "by hand" so you can see the process:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Create training and test data
data_train <- ...
data_test <- ...

# Train models on training data
model_A <- A_fun(formula = y ~ ., 
                 data = data_train)

# Model A predictions
pred_A <- predict(model_A, 
                  newdata = data_test)

# Calculate Model A error
pred_err_A <- mean(abs(pred_A - data_test$y))

# Compare to Models B, C, D...
```

]

.pull-right35[


If you're really into machine learning, packages such as `mlr` and `caret` can automate much of the the machine learning process.

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE, out.width = "95%", fig.align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/therbootcamp/therbootcamp.github.io/master/_sessions/_image/mlrcaret.png")
