# R

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_model) (emphasis added):

> R is an **open source programming language** and software environment for **statistical computing and graphics** that is supported by the R Foundation for Statistical Computing. The R language is **widely used among statisticians and data miners** for developing statistical software and data analysis. Polls, surveys of data miners, and studies of scholarly literature databases show that **R's popularity has increased substantially in recent years**.

> R is a GNU package. The source code for the R software environment is written primarily in **C, Fortran, and R**. R is freely available under the GNU General Public License, and pre-compiled binary versions are provided for various operating systems. While R has a command line interface, there are several **graphical front-ends available**.

# Programming language

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_model) (emphasis added):

> A programming language is a **formal language** that specifies a set of instructions that can be used to produce various kinds of output. Programming languages generally consist of **instructions for a computer**. Programming languages can be used to create programs that **implement specific algorithms**.

### Algorithm

# A short history on R

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language) (emphasis added):

.pull-left6[
> R is an implementation of the **S programming language** combined with **lexical scoping** semantics [environments] inspired by Scheme. [...] There are some important differences, but much of the code written for S runs unaltered.

>R was created by **Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman** [...] and is currently developed by the **R Development Core Team** [...]. R is named partly after the first names of the first two R authors and partly as a play on the name of S. The project was conceived in 1992, with an initial version released in 1995 and a **stable beta version in 2000**.

# R is widely used

R steadily **grows in popularity**. Today, R is one of the **most popular languages for data science** and overall. In terms of the number of data science jobs, **R beats SAS and Matlab**, and is on par with Python:

# R is so popular because

Although R has been implemented in **C, Fortran, and R**, R is often a slow and inefficient language. Yet, R's there are many good reasons to use R. 

.pull-left5[
### Pro
1. **It's free**
2. Relatively **easy**
3. **Extensibility** ([CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/), packages)
4. **User base** (e.g., [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/))
5. [**Tidyverse**](https://www.tidyverse.org/) (`dplyr`, `ggplot`, etc.)
6. [**RStudio**](https://www.rstudio.com/)
7. **Producitivity** options: [Latex](https://www.latex-project.org/), [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), [GitHub](https://github.com/)
]

.pull-right5[
### Con
1. Slow and wordy
2. Limited (no iterators, pointers, etc.)

$\rightarrow$ [Rcpp](http://www.rcpp.org/), [rPython](http://rpython.r-forge.r-project.org/)

# RStudio: R's favorite environment

Next to many useful packages, R users greatly benefit from R's integrated development environment [**RStudio**](https://www.rstudio.com/). Rstudio is a **graphical user interface** that allows you to (a) edit code, (b) run code, (c) access files and progress, and (d) create plots. In addition RStudio helps you with **version control** via [Github](https://github.com/), to write **reports** using [markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_basics.html) and [knitr](https://yihui.name/knitr/), integrating **C++** into R, writing **clean code**, and to **debug** code.<br><br>

# Project management

RStudio facilitate project management via the use of *projects*. Projects support:

.pull-left5[
1. **File management** by automatically setting the working directory (see `setwd()`)
<br><br>
2. **Project transitioning** by saving re-opening scripts, history, and workspace.
<br><br>
3. **Customization** by enabling project specific settings.
<br><br>
4. **Version control** by linking projects to repositories (e.g., using [GitHub](https://github.com/))

# The almighty **tidyverse**

Among its many packages, R contains a collection of high-performance, easy-to-use packages (libraries) designed specifically for handling data know as the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/). The tidyverse includes:
1. `ggplot2` -- creating graphics.
2. `dplyr` -- data manipulation.
3. `tidyr` -- tidying data.
4. `readr` -- read wild data.
5. `purrr` -- functional programming.
6. `tibble` -- modern data frame.
<br><br>

# Calls, assignments, and expressions

In R every action is a function call. Specifically, R programs advance by **passing on arguments to functions**, **calling the function**, and **receiving and storing its output**. And this goes deep, many operations are functions in disguise.

.pull-left45[
```{r}
# defining a function - arithm. mean
my_fun <- function(x, b){ x * b }

# define some data
my_data <- c(1, 5, 7, 3) 

# pass on arguments and call function
my_fun(my_data, 5) 

# store output by assignment
my_out <- my_fun(my_data, 5)
```

]

.pull-right45[
```{r}
# a basic expression
2 + 2

# is also a function
'+'(2,2)

```
]

---

# Object-orientation

R is an object-oriented language. This means that for R that **everything is an object** (including functions). This also means that there are several **generic functions** that respond to the **object's class**. Another important feature of R regarding objects is that R **always copies deep**. This is why practically everything in R is an assignment. 


```{r}
# creating a vector and testing its class (type of object)
my_vector <- c(1, 5, 2)
print(class(my_vector))

# testing the class (aka object type) of an object
print(my_vector)

# Sorting 
sort(my_vector)  
print(my_vector) # still unsorted

```


---

# Syntax style

Every language has a specific expressive style. R is characterized by the following elements...

.pull-left35[
+ Comment symbol `#`
<br2>
+ Quotations with either `""` or ''
<br2>
+ Curly brackets `{}` enclose expressions explicitly
<br2>
+ Parentheses `()` call functions
<br2>
+ Semicolon `;` separates expressions
<br2>
+ `<`,`>`,`|`,`&`,`==`, `!=` define logical statements
]


.pull-right55[
```{r, eval = F}
# This is a comment

# Quotes are used to define strings
"a" == 'a'

# Expression and calls
my_fun(x,y){ x  + y }

# two expression in one line
2 + 2 ; 3 + 3

# are these equal/different
2 == 2 ; 2 != 2

```

.pull-left5[
# Help

An facilitator for using R are **help files** and **vignettes**. Help files are required documentations for every R function and package published on [**CRAN**](https://cran.r-project.org/). Don't worry if help files may appear cryptical, however, over time you will realise how helpful they are. **Vignettes** are long tutorials sometimes provided by the authors of a package.     

```{r, eval = F}
# To access help files
help("name_of_function")
?name_of_function

# find help files
??name_of_function

# To list and access vignettes
vignette(package="name_of_package")
vignette(package="name_of_vignette")
```

# Packages

One of the huge benefits of R is its vast and cutting-edge collection of **packages**. Responsible for this is R's large and active user base, but also the [**CRAN**](https://cran.r-project.org/), who examine every package, apply a rigorous quality control, and eventually host the packages on various mirrors throughout the world. Note: when downloading one of the many packages never forget that the package must also be loaded.        

```{r, eval = F}
# To install a package
install.packages('package_name')

# load a package
library(package_name)
require(package_name)

```
