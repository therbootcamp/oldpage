# R

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_model) (emphasis added):

> R is an **open source programming language** and software environment for **statistical computing and graphics** that is supported by the R Foundation for Statistical Computing. The R language is **widely used among statisticians and data miners** for developing statistical software and data analysis. Polls, surveys of data miners, and studies of scholarly literature databases show that **R's popularity has increased substantially in recent years**.

> R is a GNU package. The source code for the R software environment is written primarily in **C, Fortran, and R**. R is freely available under the GNU General Public License, and pre-compiled binary versions are provided for various operating systems. While R has a command line interface, there are several **graphical front-ends available**.

# Programming language

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_model) (emphasis added):

> A programming language is a **formal language** that specifies a set of instructions that can be used to produce various kinds of output. Programming languages generally consist of **instructions for a computer**. Programming languages can be used to create programs that **implement specific algorithms**.

.pull-left4[
### Algorithm
1. Load data
2. Extract variables
3. Run analysis
4. Print result

### Implementation in R

# A short history on R

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language) (emphasis added):

.pull-left6[
> R is an implementation of the **S programming language** combined with **lexical scoping** semantics [environments] inspired by Scheme. [...] There are some important differences, but much of the code written for S runs unaltered.

>R was created by **Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman** [...] and is currently developed by the **R Development Core Team** [...]. R is named partly after the first names of the first two R authors and partly as a play on the name of S. The project was conceived in 1992, with an initial version released in 1995 and a **stable beta version in 2000**.

### Use R (today) for...
1. Importing and exporting data
2. Handle and process data
3. Run cutting-edge analyses
4. Analyze big data
5. Create publication-ready figures
6. Prepare reproducible reports

### Don't use R for...
1. OS programs
2. GUIs
3. Complex websites

# R is widely used

.pull-left3[
R steadily **grows in popularity**. 

Today, R is one of the **most popular languages for data science** and overall. 

In terms of the number of data science jobs, **R beats SAS and Matlab**, and is on par with Python:

# R is so popular because

There are many good reasons to prefer R over superficially more user friendly software such as **Excel** or **SPSS** or more complex programming languages like **C++** or **Python**. 

.pull-left45[
### Pro
1. **It's free**
2. Relatively **easy**
3. **Extensibility** ([CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/), packages)
4. **User base** (e.g., [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/))
5. [**Tidyverse**](https://www.tidyverse.org/) (`dplyr`, `ggplot`, etc.)
6. [**RStudio**](https://www.rstudio.com/)
7. **Productivity** options: [Latex](https://www.latex-project.org/), [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), [GitHub](https://github.com/)
]

.pull-right45[
### Con
1. Sometimes slow and wordy, but... 

[Rcpp](http://www.rcpp.org/), [BH](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/BH/index.html): Links R to C++ and high-performance C++ libraries<br>
[rPython](http://rpython.r-forge.r-project.org/): Links R to Python<br>
[RHadoop](https://github.com/RevolutionAnalytics/RHadoop/wiki): Links R to Hadoop for big data applications.<br>

# RStudio: R's favorite environment

Next to many useful packages, R users greatly benefit from R's integrated development environment [**RStudio**](https://www.rstudio.com/). Rstudio is a **graphical user interface** that allows you to (a) edit code, (b) run code, (c) access files and history, and (d) create plots. RStudio also helps you with **project management**, **version control** via [Github](https://github.com/), writing **reports** using [markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_basics.html) and [knitr](https://yihui.name/knitr/), and many other aspects of working with R.

# Project management

RStudio facilitate project management via the use of *projects*. Projects support:

.pull-left5[
1. **File management** by automatically setting the working directory (see `setwd()`)
<br><br>
2. **Project transitioning** by saving re-opening scripts, history, and workspace.
<br><br>
3. **Customization** by enabling project specific settings.
<br><br>
4. **Version control** by linking projects to repositories (e.g., using [GitHub](https://github.com/))

# The almighty **tidyverse**

Among its many packages, R newly contains a collection of high-performance, user-friendly packages (libraries)  known as the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/). The tidyverse includes:
1. `ggplot2` -- creating graphics.
2. `dplyr` -- data manipulation.
3. `tidyr` -- tidying data.
4. `readr` -- read wild data.
5. `purrr` -- functional programming.
6. `tibble` -- modern data frame.
<br><br>

# Calls, assignments, and expressions

R programs evolve through functions: Every action entails **passing on arguments (aka objects) to a function**, **calling (aka executing) the function**, and **printing or storing its output**. And this goes deep, many operations are functions in disguise.

.pull-left45[
```{r}
# defining a function - arithm. mean
my_fun <- function(x, b){ x * b }

# define some data
my_data <- c(1, 5, 7, 3) 

# pass on arguments and call function
my_fun(my_data, 5) 

# store output by assignment
my_out <- my_fun(my_data, 5)
```

]

.pull-right45[
```{r}
# a basic expression
2 + 2

# is also a function
'+'(2,2)

```
]

# Object-orientation

R is an object-oriented language. For us this entails:<br> 
>(a) **Everything is an object** (including functions).<br>
>(b) **Generic functions** that respond to the **object's class**.<br>
>(c) R **always copies deep**, implying that we always need to assign the output of a result.<br>

.pull-left45[
```{r}
# creating a vector and testing its class
my_vector <- c(1, 5, 2)
class(my_vector)

# testing the class of an object
print(my_vector)

```
]

.pull-right45[
```{r}
# Sorting a vector
sort(my_vector)  
print(my_vector) # still unsorted

```
]

# Syntax style

Programming languages have different expressive styles. R uses...

.pull-left35[
+ **Comment** symbol `#`
<br2>
+ **Quotations** with either `" "` or ' '
<br2>
+ Curly brackets `{}` **enclose expressions** explicitly
<br2>
+ Parentheses `()` **call functions**
<br2>
+ Semicolon `;` **separates expressions**
<br2>
+ `<`,`>`,`|`,`&`,`==`, `!=` define **logical statements**
]


.pull-right55[
```{r, eval = F}
# This is a comment

# Quotes are used to define strings
"a" == 'a'

# Expression and calls
my_fun(x,y){ x  + y }

# two expression in one line
2 + 2 ; 3 + 3

# are these equal/different
2 == 2 ; 2 != 2

```

# Help

.pull-left5[

R provides extremely helpful **help files** and **vignettes**. 
>**Help files** are required documentations for every R function and package published on [**CRAN**](https://cran.r-project.org/).<br>
>**Vignettes** are long tutorials sometimes provided by the authors of a package.     

```{r, eval = F}
# To access help files
help("name_of_function")
?name_of_function

# find help files
??name_of_function

# To list and access vignettes
vignette(package="name_of_package")
vignette(package="name_of_vignette")

# Packages

One of R's best features is its vast and cutting-edge collection of **packages** provided by R's large and highly active user base and the work of [**CRAN**](https://cran.r-project.org/), who apply a rigorous quality control and eventually host the packages on various mirrors throughout the world.         

```{r, eval = F}
# To install a package
install.packages('package_name')

# load a package
library(package_name)
require(package_name)


#Note: Never forget that packages must also be loaded.
