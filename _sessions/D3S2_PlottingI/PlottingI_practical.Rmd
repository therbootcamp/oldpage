### Slides

[Here are the introduction slides for this practical on Plotting 1.0: ggplot!](https://therbootcamp.github.io/_sessions/D3S2_PlottingI/PlottingI.html)


### Overview

In this practical you'll practice plotting data with the `ggplot2` package. 

### Cheatsheet

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = 'center', eval = TRUE, fig.cap= "https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/ggplot2-cheatsheet.pdf", out.width = "60%"}
knitr::include_graphics("../_image/ggplot_cheatsheet_ss.png")
```

If you don't have it already, you can access the `ggplot2` cheatsheet here [https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/ggplot2-cheatsheet.pdf](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/ggplot2-cheatsheet.pdf). This has a nice overview of all the major functions in ggplot2.

### Examples

- The following examples will take you through the steps of creating both simple and complex plots with `ggplot2`. Try to go through each line of code and see how it works!

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
# -----------------------------------------------
# Examples of using ggplot2 on the mpg data
# ------------------------------------------------

library(tidyverse)         # Load tidyverse (which contains ggplot2!)

mpg # Look at the mpg data

# Just a blank space without any aesthetic mappings
ggplot(data = mpg)

# Set the overall plotting theme
theme_set(theme_bw())   # theme_bw(), theme_minimal(), theme_classic()

# Now add a mapping where engine displacement (displ) and highway miles per gallon (hwy) are mapped to the x and y aesthetics
ggplot(data = mpg, 
       mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))   # Map displ to x-axis and hwy to y-axis

#  Add points with geom_point()
ggplot(data = mpg, 
       mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
       geom_point()     

#  Add points with geom_count()
ggplot(data = mpg, 
       mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
       geom_count()   

# Again, but with some additional arguments
# Also using a new theme temporarily

ggplot(data = mpg, 
       mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
       geom_point(col = "red",                  # Red points
                  size = 3,                     # Larger size
                  alpha = .5,                   # Transparent points
                  position = "jitter") +        # Jitter the points         
         scale_x_continuous(limits = c(1, 15)) +  # Axis limits
         scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 50)) +
  theme_minimal()


# Assign class to the color aesthetic and add labels with labs()

ggplot(data = mpg, 
  mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, col = class)) +  # Change color based on class column
  geom_point(size = 3, position = 'jitter') +
  labs(x = "Engine Displacement in Liters",
       y = "Highway miles per gallon",
       title = "MPG data",
       subtitle = "Cars with higher engine displacement tend to have lower highway mpg",
       caption = "Source: mpg data in ggplot2")
  

# Add a regression line for each class

ggplot(data = mpg, 
       mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = class)) +
  geom_point(size = 3, alpha = .9) + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")

# Add a regression line for all classes

ggplot(data = mpg, 
       mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = class)) +
  geom_point(size = 3, alpha = .9) + 
  geom_smooth(col = "blue", method = "lm")


# Facet by class
ggplot(data = mpg,
       mapping = aes(x = displ, 
                     y = hwy, 
                     color = factor(cyl))) + 
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~ class) 


# Another fancier example

ggplot(data = mpg, 
       mapping = aes(x = cty, y = hwy)) + 
       geom_count(aes(color = manufacturer)) +     # Add count geom (see ?geom_count)
       geom_smooth() +                   # smoothed line without confidence interval
       geom_text(data = filter(mpg, cty > 25), 
                 aes(x = cty,y = hwy, 
                     label = rownames(filter(mpg, cty > 25))),
                     position = position_nudge(y = -1), 
                                check_overlap = TRUE, 
                     size = 5) + 
       labs(x = "City miles per gallon", 
            y = "Highway miles per gallon",
            title = "City and Highway miles per gallon", 
            subtitle = "Numbers indicate cars with highway mpg > 25",
            caption = "Source: mpg data in ggplot2",
            color = "Manufacturer", 
            size = "Counts")
```

## Tasks

### Getting the data and project setup

1. Open a new R script and save it under the name `plotting_practical.R`

2. Load the `tidyverse` package (which includes ggplot2).

```{r, eval = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(speff2trial)
library(car)
library(FFTrees)
```

### Building a plot step-by-step

3. The `diamonds` dataset in the `ggplot2` package shows information about 50,000 round cut diamonds. Print the `diamonds` dataset, it should look like this:

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
diamonds
```

4. Using `ggplot()`, create the following blank plot using the `data` and `mapping` arguments (but no geom).

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 4}
ggplot(data = diamonds, 
       mapping = aes(x = carat, y = price))
```

5. Now, using `geom_point()`, add points showing the relationship between the number of carats in the diamonds (`carat`) and its price (`price`)

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 4}
ggplot(data = diamonds, 
       mapping = aes(x = carat, y = price)) + 
  geom_point()
```

6. Make the points transparent using the `alpha` argument to `geom_point()`

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 4}
ggplot(data = diamonds, 
       mapping = aes(x = carat, y = price)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = .05)
```

7. Using the `color` aesthetic maping, color the points by their cut.

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 4}
ggplot(data = diamonds, 
  mapping = aes(x = carat, y = price, color = cut)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = .05)
```

8. Using the `facet_wrap()` function, create different plots for each value of `cut`.

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 2}
ggplot(data = diamonds, 
       mapping = aes(x = carat, y = price, color = cut)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = .05) + 
  facet_wrap(~ cut, nrow = 1)
```

9. Using the `geom_smooth()` funciton, add a black, smoothed mean line to each plot (You can also try turning the line into a regression line using the `method` argument)

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 2}
ggplot(data = diamonds, 
       mapping = aes(x = carat, y = price, color = cut)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = .05) + 
  facet_wrap(~ cut, nrow = 1) + 
  geom_smooth(color = "black")
```


### Playing with themes

10. Look at the theme help menu with `?theme_bw()` to see a list of all of the standard ggplot themes. Then, using the `theme_set()` function, try setting your global theme to different themes. When you do, evaluate your previous plotting code again to see the new themes in action!

11. The `ggthemes` package contains many additional themes. If you don't have the package already, install it. Then, look at the `ggthemes()` vignette by running the following code:

```{r, echo = TRUE}
# Open the ggthemes vignette
vignette("ggthemes", package = "ggthemes")
```

12. Now, create the following plot from the `mpg` data using the using the Five Thirty Eight theme. Note that `cty` is on the x axis, and `hwy` is on the y axis.

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 6}
library(ggthemes)

ggplot(data = mpg, aes(x = cty, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "City vs highway miles per gallon") +
  facet_wrap(~manufacturer) +
  theme_fivethirtyeight()
```


### Density geom with `geom_density()`

13. Create the following density plot of prices from the `diamonds` data using the following template:

   - Set the `data` argument to `diamonds`
   - Map `carat` to the x aesthetic
   - Add a density geom with `geom_density()` and set the fill color to `"tomato1"`
   - Add labels
   - Use the minimal theme with `theme_minimal()`

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
ggplot(data = XX, 
       mapping = aes(x = XX)) + 
       geom_density(fill = "XX") + 
       labs(x = "XX", 
            y = "XX", 
            title = "XX",
            subtitle = "XX",
            caption = "XX")
```


```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE, fig.width = 4, fig.height = 4}
ggplot(data = diamonds, 
       mapping = aes(x = carat)) + 
  geom_density(fill = "tomato1") + 
  labs(x = "Carats", 
       y = "Count", 
       title = "Diamond Prices",
       subtitle = "Created with ggplot!",
       caption = "Source: diamonds dataset")
```

### Boxplot geom `geom_boxplot()`

14. Look at the help menu for `geom_boxplot()`. Then, create the following boxplot using the following template

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
ggplot(data = XX,
  mapping = aes(x = XX, y = log(XX), fill = XX)) + 
  geom_boxplot()  + 
  labs(y = "XX", 
       x = "XX", 
       color = "XX",
       title = "XX",
       subtitle = "XX") +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "XX")
```


```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 4}
ggplot(data = diamonds,
  mapping = aes(x = cut, y = log(price), fill = cut)) + 
  geom_boxplot()  + 
  labs(y = "Price (log scale)", x = "Cut", color = "Cut", 
       title = "Distribution of diamond prices by cut", 
       subtitle = "Data come from a random sample of 1000 diamonds",
       caption = "Source: diamonds dataset from ggplot2") +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "YlGnBu")
```

### Violin geom `geom_violin()`

15. Now make the following plot using `geom_violin()`. You can also change the color palette in the `palette` argument to the `scale_fill_brewer()` function. Look at the help menu with `?scale_fill_brewer()` to see all the possibilities. In the plot below, I'm using `"Set1"`

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 4}
ggplot(data = diamonds,
  mapping = aes(x = cut, y = log(price), fill = cut)) + 
  geom_violin()  + 
  labs(y = "Price (log scale)", x = "Cut", color = "Cut", 
       title = "Distribution of diamond prices by cut", 
       subtitle = "Data come from a random sample of 1000 diamonds",
       caption = "Source: diamonds dataset from ggplot2") +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set1")
```


### Summary statistics

16. You can use the `stat_summary()` function to add summary statistics as geoms to plots. Using the following template, create the following plot showing the mean prices of diamonds for each level of clarity.

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(data = XX,
  mapping = aes(x = XX, y = XX)) + 
stat_summary(fun.y = "mean", 
             geom = "bar", 
             fill = "white", 
             col = "black") +
  labs(y = "XX", 
       x = "XX", 
       color = "XX", 
       title = "XX", 
       caption = "XX")
```


```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 4}
ggplot(data = diamonds,
  mapping = aes(x = clarity, y = price)) + 
stat_summary(fun.y = "mean", 
             geom = "bar", 
             fill = "white", 
             col = "black") +
  labs(y = "Mean Price", 
       x = "Clarity", 
       color = "Clarity", 
       title = "Mean diamond prices by Clarity", 
       caption = "Source: diamonds dataset from ggplot2")
```

17. Now, create the following plot from the `mpg` dataframe

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 6}
ggplot(data = mpg,
  mapping = aes(x = manufacturer, y = hwy)) + 
stat_summary(fun.y = "mean", 
             geom = "bar", 
             fill = "white", 
             col = "black") +
  labs(y = "Highway Miles per gallon", 
       x = "Manufacturer", 
       title = "Average fuel efficiency for different car manufacturers", 
       caption = "Source: mpg dataset from ggplot2")
```


18. You can easily flip the coordinates of a plot by using `coord_flip()`. Using `coord_flip()`, flip the x and y coordinates of your previous plot so it looks like this:

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 6}
ggplot(data = mpg,
  mapping = aes(x = manufacturer, y = hwy)) + 
stat_summary(fun.y = "mean", 
             geom = "bar", 
             fill = "white", 
             col = "black") +
  labs(y = "Highway Miles per gallon", 
       x = "Manufacturer", 
       title = "Average fuel efficiency for different car manufacturers", 
       caption = "Source: mpg dataset from ggplot2") + coord_flip()
```


### Saving plots as objects

19. Create the following plot from the `mpg` dataset, and save it as an object called `myplot`

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 4}

myplot <- ggplot(data = mpg,
                 aes(x = cty, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "City Miles per Gallon",
       y = "Highway Miles per Gallon",
       title = "mpg data")

myplot
```


20. Now, using object assignment `<-` add a regression line to the `myplot` object with `geom_smooth()`. Then evaluate the object to see the updated version. It should now look like this:

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 4}
myplot + geom_smooth()
```

21. Using `ggsave()`, save the object as a pdf file called `myplot.pdf`. Set the width to 6 inches, and the height to 4 inches. Open the pdf outside of RStudio to make sure it worked!

### Demographic information of midwest counties in the US

22. Print the `midwest` dataset and look at the help menu to see what values it contains. It should look like this:

```{r, eval = TRUE}
midwest
```

23. Using the following code as a template, create the following plot showing the relationship between college education and poverty

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 5}
ggplot(data = XX, 
    mapping = aes(x = XX, y = XX)) + 
    geom_point(aes(fill = XX, size = XX), shape = 21, color = "white") + 
    geom_smooth(aes(x = XX, y = XX)) +
    labs(
        x = "XX", 
        y = "XX", 
        title = "XX",
        subtitle = "XX",
        caption = "XX") + 
    scale_color_brewer(palette = "XX") + 
    scale_size(range = c(XX, XX)) +
    guides(size = guide_legend(override.aes = list(col = "black")), 
           fill = guide_legend(override.aes = list(size = 5)))
```


```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 5}
ggplot(data = midwest, 
    mapping = aes(x = percollege, y = percpovertyknown)) + 
    geom_point(aes(fill = state, size = popdensity), shape = 21, color = "white") + 
    geom_smooth(aes(x = percollege, y = percpovertyknown)) +
    labs(
        x = "Percent with college education", 
        y = "Poverty rate", 
        title = "Midwest Data",
        subtitle = "States with higher college education rates tend to have lower poverty rates",
        caption = "Source: ggplot2 package") + 
    scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set1") + 
    scale_size(range = c(0, 12)) +
    guides(size = guide_legend(override.aes = list(col = "black")), 
           fill = guide_legend(override.aes = list(size = 5)))
```



24. Create the following density plot showing the density of inhabitants with a college education in different states using the following template

```{r, echo = TRUE}
ggplot(data = XX, 
       mapping = aes(XX, fill = XX)) + 
  geom_density(alpha = XX) + 
  labs(title = "XX", 
       subtitle = "XX",
       caption = "XX",
       x = "XX",
       y = "XX",
       fill = "XX")
```


```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 5}
ggplot(data = midwest, 
       mapping = aes(percollege, fill = state)) + 
  geom_density(alpha = 0.8) + 
  labs(title = "College education rates", 
       subtitle = "For 5 Midwest states",
       caption = "Source: midwest dataset in ggplot2",
       x = "Percent of inhabitants with a college education",
       y = "Density",
       fill = "State") + 
  theme_bw()
```


### Heatplots with `geom_tile()`

25. You can create heatplots using the `geom_tile()` function. Try creating the following heatplot of statistics of NBA players using the following template:

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# Read in nba data
nba_long <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/therbootcamp/therbootcamp.github.io/master/_sessions/_data/nba_long.csv")

ggplot(XX, 
       mapping = aes(x = XX, y = XX, fill = XX)) + 
  geom_tile(colour = "XX") + 
  scale_fill_gradientn(colors = c("XX", "XX", "XX"))+ 
  labs(x = "XX", 
       y = "XX", 
       fill = "XX", 
       title = "NBA XX performance",
       subtitle = "XX",
       caption = "XX") +
  coord_flip()
```


```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE, fig.width = 10, fig.height = 12}
# Read in nba data
nba_long <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/therbootcamp/therbootcamp.github.io/master/_sessions/_data/nba_long.csv")

ggplot(nba_long, 
       mapping = aes(x = Name, y = measure, fill = value)) + 
  geom_tile(colour = "white") + 
  scale_fill_gradientn(colors = c("red", "white", "blue"))+ 
  labs(x = "Player", 
       y = "Statistic", 
       fill = "Performance", 
       title = "NBA player performance",
       subtitle = "Each tile represents how well the player performed on that statistic relative to other players.",
       caption = "Source: https://learnr.wordpress.com/2010/01/26/ggplot2-quick-heatmap-plotting/") +
  coord_flip() + 
  theme_minimal()
```


26. Make the following plot of savings data (`psavert`) from the `economics` dataset.

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(data = XX, aes(x = XX, y = XX)) + 
       geom_line() + 
       labs(title = "XX", 
            subtitle = "XX", 
            caption = "XX", 
            y = "XX") + 
       geom_smooth()
```

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, fig.width = 10, fig.height = 6}
# plot
ggplot(data = economics, 
       mapping = aes(x = date, y = psavert)) + 
  geom_line() + 
  geom_smooth() +
  labs(title = "Personal Savings Rates Changes over Time", 
       subtitle = "Ratio of personal saving to disposable income", 
       caption = "Source:  http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2", 
       y = "Savings Rate %") + 
  theme_bw()
```

28. Make the following plot from the `ACTG175` dataset (the dataset is contained in the `speff2trial` package). To do this, you'll need to use both `geom_boxplot()` and `geom_point()`. To jitter the points, use the `position` argument to `geom_point()`, as well as the `position_jitter()` function to control how much to jitter the points.

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, fig.width = 10, fig.height = 6}
ggplot(data = ACTG175,
       aes(x = factor(arms), y = days, fill = factor(arms))) +
   facet_wrap(~ drugs, nrow = 1, labeller = label_both) +
  geom_boxplot(outlier.size = 0) + 
  labs(title = "Number of days until a major negative event",
       subtitle = "For different treatment arms and separated by drug users and non drug users",
       caption = "Source: ACTG175 dataset from the speff2trial package",
       x = "Treatment Arm",
       y = "Number of days until a major negative event",
       fill = "Arm") +
  theme_bw() +  
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Dark2") + 
  geom_point(alpha = .2, 
             position = position_jitter(w = 0.1, h = 0))

```


30. Create the following lolipop chart from the Midwest data.

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
midwest_IL <- midwest %>% 
  filter(state == "XX") %>%
  mutate(popdensity_z = (popdensity - mean(popdensity)) / sd(popdensity)) %>%
  arrange(desc(popdensity_z)) %>%
  mutate(county = factor(county, levels = county)) %>%
  slice(1:25)

ggplot(XX, aes(x = XX, y = XX)) + 
  geom_segment(aes(y = 0, 
                   x = county, 
                   yend = popdensity_z, 
                   xend = county, 
                   col = popdensity_z), size = XX) +
  geom_point(size = XX, fill = "white", shape = 21)  +
  labs(title = "XX", 
       subtitle = "XX",
       Y = "XX",

31. Create the following heat plot using `geom_tile()`. To do this, you'll first need to create the aggregated data `mpg_agg` (see code below).

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# Calculate mean highway miles per gallon for each combination of
#  manufacturer and class

mpg_agg <- mpg %>%
  group_by(manufacturer, class) %>%
  summarise(
    hwy_mean = mean(hwy)
  )
```


```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 7}
mpg_agg <- mpg %>%
  group_by(manufacturer, class) %>%
  summarise(
    hwy_mean = mean(hwy)
  )

ggplot(mpg_agg, 
       mapping = aes(x = class, y = manufacturer, fill = hwy_mean)) + 
  geom_tile(colour = "white") + 
  scale_fill_gradientn(colors = c("red", "white", "blue")) +
  labs(title = "Mean Highway Miles per Gallon",
       x = "Manufacturer",
       y = "Class")
 
```
