# readr

`readr` is a `tidyverse` package that provides convenient functions to **read in** *flat* (non-nested) data files into data frames (`tibble`s to be precise):


.pull-left45[
```{r, eval=F}
# Functions for import
read_csv()  # for comma-delimited files
read_csv2() # for semicolon-delimeted file
read_delim()  # for any delimited files

# Functions for parsing
parse_logical() # parse logical vectors
parse_integer() # parse integers
parse_double(), parse_number()  # parse numerics
parse_character() # parse character aka string
parse_date()    # parse date -> lubridate package
```
]

.pull-right45[
```{r, out.height = "200px", echo = F}
knitr::include_graphics("http://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/66d3133b4a19949d0b9ddb95fc48da074b69fb07/7dfb6/images/hex-readr.png")
```

# An example

Assume we have a *flat* data set with variables `id`, `var_1`, and `var_2` and cases as rows. Such data can be conveniently read in using `read_csv()`. Moreover, `read_csv()` will **automatically identify** (a) columns and rows, (b) column names, (c) the type of the columns and finally return a `tibble` (more on that later).

.pull-left45[
```{r, eval = F}
# define simple data set
data <- 
   "id, var_1, var_2\n
  DCDL,  .287,  .048\n
  FEFK,  .894,  .383\n
  ZEWE, 1.374,  .623\n
  OJEE,  .631,  .826"
```
]

.pull-right45[
```{r, eval = F}
# read in data
require(readr)
read_csv(data)
```

```{r, echo = F}
# define simple data set
data <- 
   "id, var_1, var_2\n
  DCDL,  .287,  .048\n
  FEFK,  .894,  .383\n
  ZEWE, 1.374,  .623\n
  OJEE,  .631,  .826"

# read in data
require(readr)
read_csv(data)
```
]


---

# Data source

Most of R's read functions allow to load data from a **variety of sources**, including most importantly the computer's hard drive and the internet. When loading from the hard drive, use auto-complete (using *tab*) to find the right **file path**.
 
.pull-left45[
```{r, eval = T}
# Loading data from url
read_csv("https://tinyurl.com/ydgrcyt5")
```
]

.pull-right45[
```{r, eval = T}
# Loading data from url
read_csv("https://tinyurl.com/ydgrcyt5")
```
]


---

# Parsing 

Behind the magic of `readr` functions such as `read_csv` are a set of really flexible parsing functions `parse_*()` that **coerce** the input into the **appropriate format and type**. 

###Examples

.pull-left45[
```{r, warning=F}
# parsing a logical
parse_logical(c("TRUE","FALSE","NA"))

# parsing an integer + errors
parse_integer(c("123", "345", "abc", "123.45"))
```
]

.pull-right45[
```{r}
# parse
parse_character("hellow","world")

# parsing a numeric
parse_number(c("1.23","$123.209"))
```
]

---

# Locale

If parsing is not controlled using  **arguments**, it's parsing behavior will be controlled by **settings** in `locale()`. To change, e.g., the `decimal_mark` use `locale("en", decimal_mark = ",")`.

.pull-left45[
```{r, tidy = T, tidy.opts=list(width.cutoff=60)}
str(locale())
```
]

---

# Error handling

When reading a file using, e.g., `read_csv`, with no specific arguments provided, `readr` **infers the type** of each column using a heuristic process based on the **first 1,000 rows** (see `guess_parser`). However, that may not always work. In that case consider...  


```{r, eval = F}
# to inspect the problems
problems()

# to set types explicitly
read_csv(..., col_types = cols(...))

# read in as character and convert later
read_csv(..., col_types = cols(.default = col_character()))
type_convert()

# use more basic read-in functions (see later)

```

---

# Other read in options

The `tidyverse` together with other package offers a **variety of built-in, automated read functions** for almost any data format. For an overview **see** [**rio**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rio/vignettes/rio.html).

# Writing data

Most read-in functions have **matching write**-functions to save the data to disk. As **arguments** these functions usually expect a **data frame** and a **file path** on the disk.

# R's data formats

R also has data formats of its own to store and retrieve data. They provide the possibility to store **data as R objects**, as well as substantial **compression** (depending on data regularity up to about 1% of the original size). 

.pull-left45[
### `.RData`  
+ Bundles several R objects.
+ Loads objects directly to workspace.
+ Slow.
```{r, eval = F}
# save data as .RData
save(object_1, object_2,..., file = "my_data.RData")

# load data from .RData
load("my_data.RData")
```
]

.pull-right45[
### `.RDS`  
+ Stores individual R objects.
+ Import is newly assigned.
+ Fast.
```{r, eval = F}
# save data as .RDS
saveRDS(my_data, file = "my_data.rds")

# load data from .RDS
my_data <- readRDS("my_data.rds")
```
]
---

# File connections

Under the hood, practically all of R's reading and writing functions relies on a **file connection** architecture, just as most other programming languages do. To the experienced programmer file connections represent a flexible option to access and manipulate files on **any accessible location** (harddrive, server, www). 

.pull-left45[
### Benefits of file connections
+ Define access mode (read, write, append).
<br2>
+ Read/write as binary or raw.
<br2>
+ Handle encodings directly.
<br2>
+ Read and write compressed files.
<br2>
+ Access to www and servers.  
]

.pull-right45[
### Functions
```{r, eval = F}
# access a file
file("my_data.csv",'r')

# access url
url(...)

# access compressed files
gzfile(...)

# to handle connections
readLines() # to read contect
close() # close connection 
```
]

# `tibble`s

The **output** from most `tidyverse` read functions such as `read_csv` and the preferred data format for many (but not all) analyses is a `tibble`. `tibble`s are a **modern, leaner version of data.frames**. 

.pull-left45[
### tibbles ...
+ never change the input's type.
<br2>
+ never add row names.
<br2>
+ never change column names.
<br2>
+ look better in `print`. 
<br2>
+ are accessed more consistently.
]

.pull-right45[
### Functions
```{r, eval = F}
# create tibble
my_data <- tibble(id, var_1, var_2)

# convert to and from data.frame
as_tibble(my_data_frame)
as.data.frame(my_tibble)
```

```{r, echo = F}
# define simple data set
data <- 
   "id, var_1, var_2\n
  DCDL,  .287,  .048\n
  FEFK,  .894,  .383\n
  ZEWE, 1.374,  .623\n

<!--- Tibble notes

updated data.frame

# creating tibbles
as_tibble(data.frame)
tibble() # recycles just as data frame

# special about tibble
never changes format -> no factors
never changes names
never creates row names
non-valid R variables names (e.g., not starting with a letter)
better printing behavior (only 10 rows + type + dim)
no partial name matches
[ always returns a tibble (more consistent)
